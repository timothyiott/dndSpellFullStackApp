# dndSpellsAPI

This will be an API that allows the user to pull a list of spells available in DnD 5e.  

The plan? is to eventually add in the spell information as different tables.  315 spells currently exits so that would mean 315 different tables to add.

This API will include the CRUD system to allow the server to accept GET requests and allow us to POST more information and update tables.

I would also like to add a filter option along with the search function.  example: show all Illusion spells.
